How do I build this thing?

= Introduction =
Currently, Ochan doesn't meet all of its goals for deployment. It currently builds a war that is deployable to various Servlet Containers. Development is done on [http://www.mortbay.org/ Jetty].

= Details =
Dependencies are handled using Ivy, but, you really REALLY need to maintain your own ivy repository. Sadly I cant host one here, but, I do have a tar of my Ivy repository in svn. You should simply untar it, host it somewhere local to your development environment, and update the IvyConf.xml to point to it. 

Once you've done that, you can simply use the following command, against jdk 1.5:

:>ant -lib tools/apache-ivy-2.0.0-alpha2-incubating/ -lib tools/pmd-4.0/lib/ clean war


==Deploying to Jetty==
1. Copy the war to jetty
:cp scratch/Ochan.war /...../jetty-6.1.3/webapps/Ochan.war

2. Start a local database (not currently starting internal to the war)
:java -cp hsqldb-1.8.0.7.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:mydb -dbname.0 xdb

3. Start jetty with JMX enabled and in debug mode
:java -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=n -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -jar start.jar etc/jetty-jmx.xml etc/jetty.xml

4. For good measure, and configuration, start jconsole
:jconsole
