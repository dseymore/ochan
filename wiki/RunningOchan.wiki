#How to run Ochan?

= Requirements =
* Sun JDK 1.6 update 10 or later
* Jconsole or jvisualVM (both are in the jdk bin/ directory)

= Steps =
 # make sure your path is configured correctly so that you have the java command executing the correct version of the jdk. (verify with java -version)
 # Execute java -jar Ochan.jar (optional add --httpPort=80 to change default port 8080 to port 80, or any port of your choice)
 # Direct your browser to localhost:8080


== Configuration  (REQUIRED STEPS) ==
 # Now that you have it deployed, startup the mbean browser of jconsole or jvisualvm.
 # Go into System->DeploymentConfiguration and set the absolute url (or hostname if you have a dns name setup) that users use to get to the application, and the port. 
 # Go to Ochan->local->CategoryService and Add at least one category to begin your imageboard. 
 # All other defaults are normally acceptable. A configuration catalog will be created in the future.


== Some startup arguments that may help ==
=== Bumping up the maximum memory.. 1GiB===
{{{
-Xmx1024M
}}}
=== Using concurrent garbage collection ===
{{{
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode 
}}}
=== Flagging the service as headless (maybe required for thumbnails) ===
{{{
-Djava.awt.headless=true
}}}
=== Opening up remote management without a password (FIREWALL THIS!) ===
{{{
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8000
