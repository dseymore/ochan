==Rev 100 "Where'd my Images go!"==
As part of [http://code.google.com/p/ochan/issues/detail?id=10 Issue #10]

The ImagePost entity was a heavily cached entity. however, that caching was inadvertently caching the entire binary data.. but, not in a useful way.. it was only being used for the atom feeds and the front page... and not even to retrieve the binary data.. just wasting memory. 

With the config of "-Xmx2056m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m" and the same sample set of posts.. ram usage was down from 1,000 to 250 megabytes.
