#How to manage the Berkeley DB that ochan runs. 

= Introduction =
There are some tricks to maintaining an install of ochan. While it constantly keeps the database in a consistent, ready to go state; that can be backed up live, you'll probably want to clean some of its files up so that it doesn't take up too much disk space.

Also, some statistics for the health of the are exposed for you to better fine tune your deployment to your load.

== Seeing where the data is ==
  # Download the je distrubtion from the oracle site. It's embedded in ochan, and you're welcome to take it out of there, but, It wont be distributed by this project. 
  # execute: java -classpath ".:/absolute/je/path/to/je-3.3.75.jar" com.sleepycat.je.util.DbSpace  -h /absolute/ochan/deployment/path/

I dont know what to do about that yet, though. I get the impression that there is a way to delete those, but, deleting it outright is bad.
