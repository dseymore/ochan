When you go to Ochan after first starting it. Ochan is empty. There are no categories, no posts.

From Jvisualvm or Jconsole (or another JMX tool), you can configure Ochan.

And now we have a Category! The main page lists all of the categories, 3 of the most recent images posted, and statistics. Clicking on a category takes you to the category view. Clicking on an image takes you to that image in the thread view. There is also an Atom feed link at the top right hand corner. While sitting on this page, any new threads created will appear as 'toast'/'Growl' at the top right of the page.


### Category View ###

The category view shows the first and the last post of a thread, for all threads in that category. Here you can start a new thread, and include either an image upload or an image from a publicly accessible url. Clicking 'view entire thread' will take you to the thread view, and 'export' will export all of the images in that thread. Clicking on an image will take you to that image in the thread view.

The options are a moveable dialog now, that can be closed. Even when it is closed, the keyboard commands remain active.

### Thread View ###
The thread view shows all the posts in that thread. Clicking on an image here will take you to a full size view of the image. You can post a reply to that thread using either an image you upload, an image available through a publicly accessible url, or if you have a zip file full of images, you can upload that as well. On this view, any replies to the thread will appear on their own.
If you click the post number, you can make a 'reply' to a specific post. the format >>(number) creates an inter-thread post link.
